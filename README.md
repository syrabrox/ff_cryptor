# FF-Cryptor

FF-Cryptor is a Python-based file and folder encryption/decryption tool that offers enhanced security through multiple encryption algorithms (AES, TripleDES, ChaCha20) and master password protection. And your master password length will choose 1 of 6 algorithm row.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt files and folders securely.
- Supports AES, TripleDES, and ChaCha20 encryption algorithms.
- Interactive command-line interface with a user-friendly menu.
- Error handling for smooth operation.

### Setup

1. Run the program:
    - FF-Cryptor_(CLI/UI).exe

2. **Initial Setup**: 
    - Create a master password to generate an encryption key (stored in `key.key`).

3. **Main Menu**:
    - Navigate through folders and files to encrypt or decrypt.
    - Choose from options like Encrypt File, Decrypt File, Encrypt Folder, Decrypt Folder, and more.

### Encryption Algorithms

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
- **TripleDES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)**
- **ChaCha20**

### Error Handling

- Displays clear error messages with line numbers for troubleshooting.

### Notes

- System files (like `key.key`) cannot be encrypted or decrypted.
- Ensure `key.key` exists and the correct master password is provided for operations.
